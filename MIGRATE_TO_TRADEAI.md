# Migration to TRADEAI Repository

## 🚀 Creating the New TRADEAI Repository

Since the GitHub token doesn't have repository creation permissions, please follow these steps to create the new repository and migrate the codebase:

### Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `TRADEAI`
   - **Description**: `Trade AI Platform - Complete production-ready platform for trade marketing budget management with AI-powered analytics and multi-tenant architecture`
   - **Visibility**: Public (or Private if preferred)
   - **Initialize**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we'll push our existing code)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Migrate the Codebase

After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the current project
cd /path/to/trade-ai-platform-v2

# Add the new remote repository
git remote add tradeai https://github.com/Reshigan/TRADEAI.git

# Push all branches and tags to the new repository
git push tradeai main
git push tradeai --tags

# Optional: Set TRADEAI as the default remote
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Reshigan/TRADEAI.git
```

### Step 3: Update Repository Settings

1. Go to the new repository: `https://github.com/Reshigan/TRADEAI`
2. Go to Settings → General
3. Update the repository description if needed
4. Enable Issues, Projects, and Wiki if desired
5. Set up branch protection rules for `main` branch (recommended)

### Step 4: Test the Deployment

Once the repository is created and code is pushed:

```bash
# Clone the new repository
git clone https://github.com/Reshigan/TRADEAI.git
cd TRADEAI/production

# Test the deployment script
./deploy.sh
```
