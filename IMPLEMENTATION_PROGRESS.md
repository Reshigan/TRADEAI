# 🚀 Trade AI Platform - 5-Week Implementation Progress

**Start Date**: 2025-10-29  
**Current Status**: ACCELERATED IMPLEMENTATION  
**Approach**: TDD (Test-Driven Development) + Automation

---

## ⚡ Execution Strategy

### Speed & Quality Balance
1. **Write tests FIRST** - Ensure quality from start
2. **Reusable components** - Build once, use everywhere  
3. **Automated testing** - Zero manual testing
4. **Parallel development** - Multiple features simultaneously
5. **Continuous integration** - Test on every change

### Development Workflow
```
For each feature:
1. Write test fixtures (data)
2. Write tests (expected behavior)
3. Run tests (RED - they fail)
4. Write code (implementation)
5. Run tests (GREEN - they pass)
6. Refactor (improve code)
7. Commit to Git
```
