### Deployment Requirements

To complete the deployment, the following files need to be uploaded to the production server:

1. **Upload New Files**:
   ```
   /var/www/tradeai/static/js/main.b75d57d7.js
   /var/www/tradeai/static/css/main.0c7b41d8.css
   ```

2. **Update index.html**:
   Replace references from:
   - `main.7c0f48f4.js` → `main.b75d57d7.js`
   - `main.d881fcf3.css` → `main.0c7b41d8.css`

3. **Restart Services** (if needed):
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   sudo pm2 restart tradeai-backend
   ```

### Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Login functionality with seeded users
- [ ] Trading terms list loads from API
- [ ] Analytics dashboard shows real data
- [ ] Company details load budgets and trade spends
- [ ] ZAR currency displays correctly
- [ ] Date formats show as DD/MM/YYYY
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly

### Issues Identified

1. **SSL Certificate**: Currently using self-signed certificate
   - **Impact**: Browser security warnings
   - **Solution**: Deploy proper Let's Encrypt certificate
   - **Status**: Functional but needs improvement

2. **Remaining Mock Data**: Some components still contain mock data
   - **Components**: UserDetail, UserForm, PromotionDetail, BudgetDetail, CustomerDetail, ProductDetail, TradeSpendDetail, CompanyForm
   - **Impact**: These components will show placeholder data
   - **Priority**: Medium (core functionality works)

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Deploy new build files to production server
2. **Short-term**: Fix SSL certificate configuration
3. **Medium-term**: Remove remaining mock data from other components
4. **Long-term**: Implement comprehensive testing suite
